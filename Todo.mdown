#To do:
-   Get it working from `/Applications` with root access, reading the actual database.
-   Make current location button work.
-   Setings pane - text fields for custom server URLS and htaccess passwords so it's easy for others to use.
-   Credits for libraries used - ASIHTTPRequest.
-   Reset button - all records will be uploaded next time user presses button, not just new ones.

##Long term:
-   In-app map view of locations.
